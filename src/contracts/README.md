Trump vs Biden Liquidity Pool 
==========================================


Setting up an ERC20 Contract betting the odds of the 2020 Election
 > built using two identical ERC20 tokens 
 > total 20,000 tokens in the "liquidity pool" -- half trump & half biden


Key notes:

Both Biden & Trump (.sol) tokens are *fungible* tokens ( similar to bank statements)

What we need are for Trump & Biden tokens to be non-fungible ( similar to your house )



The player tokens are equivalent & interchangable ( i.e. players on a team) *fungible*

The different Leagues / sports are unique and distinct ( i.e NBA vs NFL ) *non-fungible*
